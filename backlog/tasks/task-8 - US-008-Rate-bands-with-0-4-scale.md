## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
## US-008: Rate bands with 0-4 scale

**As an** attendee
**I want** to set my rating per band on the list
**So that** the app can compute group decisions later
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Given a band in the list When I set a rating between 0 and 4 Then the rating is stored via the application use case
- [ ] #2 Given a stored rating When I reopen the band list Then the selected rating is displayed
- [ ] #3 Given an invalid rating input When I attempt to save Then the app prevents it and shows a validation message
<!-- AC:END -->
