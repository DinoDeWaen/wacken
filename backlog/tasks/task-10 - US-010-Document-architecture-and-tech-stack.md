## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
## US-010: Document architecture and tech stack

**As a** developer
**I want** a documented architecture and technology stack in the README
**So that** contributors understand how the app is structured and built
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Given the README When I open it Then I see project context, basic functionality, and architecture sections aligned with the Clean Architecture/DD DDD mandate
- [ ] #2 Given the architecture section When I read it Then it lists modules/layers, responsibilities, and key technologies (Java, Gradle, JUnit5/Mockito, Android app module)
- [ ] #3 Given setup instructions When I follow them Then I can clone the repo, install dependencies, and run tests/build the debug APK via Gradle commands
